## Specification Changes

Changes to the LLM.yml specification require careful consideration:

### Process

1. **Discuss First**: Open an issue describing the proposed change
2. **Get Consensus**: Wait for community feedback (minimum 1 week)
3. **Submit RFC**: Create a detailed RFC (Request for Comments) as a PR
4. **Review Period**: Allow 2 weeks for review
5. **Implementation**: Once approved, implement the change

### RFC Template

```markdown
# RFC: [Title]

```

## Adding Examples

Examples help users understand LLM.yml better:

### Guidelines

1. **Real Libraries**: Use actual, popular libraries
2. **Complete Examples**: Include all required sections
3. **Best Practices**: Demonstrate recommended patterns
4. **Validation**: Ensure examples pass schema validation

### Process

1. Create example file in `examples/[library-name]-llm.yml`
2. Follow the specification exactly
3. Test with the validator
4. Submit PR with description of the library

### Example Structure

```yaml
# [Library Name] LLM Documentation Example
library:
  name: actual-library-name
  version: current.version.here
  # ... rest of the example
```

## Developing Tools

### Validator Improvements

The validator is crucial for LLM.yml adoption:

1. **Features**: Add useful validation features
2. **Error Messages**: Improve clarity and helpfulness
3. **Performance**: Optimize for large files
4. **Tests**: Include comprehensive tests

### New Tools

Consider developing:

- **Generators**: Convert existing docs to LLM.yml
- **Linters**: Style and best practice checks
- **Converters**: Transform between formats
- **Integrations**: IDE plugins, CI tools

### Tool Requirements

- Written in JavaScript/TypeScript or Python
- Well-documented
- Tested
- Follow project coding standards
